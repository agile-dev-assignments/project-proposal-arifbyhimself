### Project title

    The Twitter Encouragement Bot/ Twitter Anti-Suicide Bot

###    What and why?

      The piece of software I would like to build would be a twitter bot that specifically works to reduce the toxicity of the platform. While that may be too grand of a goal of just a bot, we can still make some positive impact with this project. Twitter is infamous for its toxicity; it's quite easy to find numerous articles and think pieces about this very problem. Amnesty International even did an entire video on this issue! 

      But even beyond just the toxicity in interaction between different accounts, twitter serves as a platform for people to just post their thoughts. While tweets may not represent the most honest version of people's thoughts and beliefs, people do like ponder about the enormity of their  life problems with their followers and self-deprecation is often followed to make light of situations 

      What specifically my bot would do is respond or tweet back at accounts with tweets of encouragement and hope. And perhaps in the extreme case, it would tweet back number of the suicide hot-line for the country of the account.

### For whom?

     This piece of software isn't really a product and there really aren't "customers" per se but there is definitely a group of people it may help. Twitter boasts of having more than 350 million users in 2020 and 69 million of those are U.S users. While this bot is meant to help "everyone" in the platform, it would be mainly geared to English users and particularly to American accounts. It would be much easier to analyze the tweets of users who tweet in English. 

      Thinking even more specifically, this would probably be mainly geared towards the 18-30 year old range because this age range makes the largest percentage of Twitter users and I suspect that its in this age range where people feel comfortable with tweeting out their daily life problems!

### How?

    Twitter has a very well documented public API and very complete system of creating bots and with this we can locate the users we would like to "help". 

    If the Twitter Bot detects that a very negative tweet is made, the bot may examine the last few tweets made by that user, under a certain time span. If it finds that tweeting negatively about one's life is a common occurrence (like a big fraction of the user tweets are negative) then the bot would respond to the user.

   The words of encouragement would come from an array of quotes that the bot would tweet back at the user.

### Scope

    I think this is quite an appropriate project for 4 to 6 programmers. Twitter's documented API and its well crafted bot system will make it not impossible to do in the time span even if there are members in the group who are not well versed in api use or even programming.

    It also won't be too easy in that we would have to develop methods of detecting "sadness" or "depression". We would have to figure how to separate sincere tweets from humor. We would also look at how it would respond to millions of tweets at once! And I think this part will make sure our hands are definitely full!
